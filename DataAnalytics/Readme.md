### Dashboard Goals
Generation of an interactive board that supports the decision to electrify the fleet of taxis.

###KPI's

*Environmental* : CO2 emission rate: 56.12. It means that combustion cars generate 56 times more CO2 emissions than electric vehicles.

*Economic*: Total cost of electrification: 6.85 Million US dollars. It means that the process, the acquisition of 100 units of electric vehicles and 50 electric chargers to have at the charging points, would mean an initial investment cost (without taking into consideration driver salaries, taxes or government subsidies) of 6.85 million US dollars.

*Economic*: Gain of electric cars over combustion cars: 1.35. It means that more profit is perceived from electrification.

*Economic*: Return on Investment: 0.41 evaluated per year. It means that the investment is greater than the profits received in one year of project implementation but that they will be substantially modified over the years, being able to notice perceivable benefits (return on investment greater than 1) after 4 years.


*Sociocultural*: Rate of inhabitants per station: 34050 inhabitants/charging point. This KPI describes a characteristic of low electrification of transport in CDMX, which allows comparing it with the future of the project, contributing to the acquisition of the general public to acquire EVs due to the installation of charging points distributed in the city and the electrification of the CDMX taxi service.

### Graphics

The graph of average CO2 emissions per year from New York City taxi trips was generated (Fig 1) and plotted against time (years). An upward trend is verified, indicating that the emissions generated by this tertiary sector increase with the passing of the year despite the efforts of the city government to reduce emissions. It is important to consider that the possible sources of this increase in emissions are due to longer journey lengths or longer journey times (drop off time - pick up time) due to considerations such as city traffic and congestion, as well as urbanization variables. The impact of an increase in the number of trips is neglected due to the use of the average for the generation of the graph.

A graph of the number of electric cars in NYC per year was built, where it is perceived that as the years go by, electrification is more important, supported by government efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement of 2015, of which the US is a signatory, and greater social acceptance of the implementation of electric fleets.
